# Car_Management_System-Project-Using-C++-
🚗 Car Management System – C++ Project

This is a menu-driven Car Management System developed in C++. The project provides an interactive console application for managing user profiles, exploring different car brands, viewing car details, and simulating car purchasing with billing.

It demonstrates the use of C++ fundamentals such as:

Functions & Loops

Conditional Statements

File Handling

User Input Handling

Arrays & Menu Systems

✨ Features

✔️ User Profile Management – Enter and save user details (name, phone, CNIC) using file handling.
✔️ Car Brands Available – Choose from MERCEDES-BENZ, HONDA, SUZUKI, and TOYOTA.
✔️ Car Models & Details – Each brand offers 5 models with complete specifications:

Engine type

Transmission details

Horsepower / Fuel Economy

Price (in PKR)
✔️ Car Purchase Simulation – User can input payment details and get a full bill including:

Car Price

Discount (15%)

Sales Tax (5%)

Labor Charges
✔️ Budget Range Option – Enter your budget to see available car options in that price range.
✔️ Console-based Menu – User-friendly menu system with clear navigation.
